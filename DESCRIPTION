Description: A common feature across genomic data types, including genome, 
  epigenome, transcriptome, microbiome, metabolome, etc., is dependencies among 
  variables. Improvements in genomic technologies accompanied by decreasing costs
  have led to vastly increasing amounts of information collected from individual 
  tissue samples. However, this increase in information is often accompanied by 
  increasing dependencies among variables. This dynamic has fueled the need for 
  methods to reduce dimensionality of datasets by summarizing multiple dependent 
  variables into fewer and less dependent variables. Dimension reduction has 
  multiple benefits including reduced computational demands, 
  reduced multiple-testing challenge, better-behaved data, and possible increase 
  in statistical power to detect associations with external variables. 
  Algorithms included here use an agglomerative partitioning framework and share 
  the following goals, 1) minimum information loss given the achieved reduction in
  dimensionality, 2) each original variable maps to one and only one variable in 
  the reduced dataset, 3) a user specified maximum amount of information loss. The
  framework can be described as a partitioning of the original features into 
  subsets of similar variables with a function applied to each subset to 
  summarize it into a single new variable. Each partition/new variable pair 
  satisfies a maximum information loss criterion, and the overall goal is to 
  minimize the number of partitions subject to that criterion.
